# React Mastery

Modern React (v19) — from fundamentals to advanced patterns.

## What's Covered

- **Components & Props** — functional components, composition, conditional/list rendering
- **Hooks** — useState, useEffect, useRef, useReducer
- **Custom Hooks** — reusable logic extraction
- **Advanced Patterns** — Context API, compound components, render props, HOCs, error boundaries
- **React 19** — useActionState, useOptimistic, use() hook, server components

## Setup

```bash
# Option 1: Vite (recommended)
npm create vite@latest react-exercises -- --template react
cd react-exercises
npm install
npm run dev

# Option 2: Quick sandbox
# Paste exercises into https://codesandbox.io or https://stackblitz.com
```

## Difficulty Levels

- 🟢 Easy — foundational concepts
- 🟡 Medium — requires combining concepts
- 🔴 Hard — advanced patterns and edge cases

## How to Practice

1. Work through exercises in order — each file builds on previous concepts
2. Try solving before checking solutions
3. Use speed-typing snippets daily to build muscle memory
4. Review interview questions before interviews
5. Log failed interview questions in `failed-interviews.md`
