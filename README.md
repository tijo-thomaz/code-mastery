## 🚀 How to Use This Repo

### 1. Fork & Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/code-mastery.git
cd code-mastery
```

### 2. Pick a Language → Open Exercises

Each exercise file has **numbered challenges** with clear instructions.
Try solving them **without looking at solutions first**.

### 3. Check Solutions

Solutions are in the matching `solutions/` folder with detailed explanations.

### 4. Speed Typing Practice

Open any `speed-typing/` folder and **type the snippets from memory**.
Use tools like [SpeedCoder](https://www.speedcoder.net/) or just type in your editor.

**Goal:** Type common patterns without thinking — like a pianist plays scales.

### 5. Interview Prep

Review the `interview-questions/` folders and the `failed-interviews/` journal.
Practice explaining your answers **out loud** (rubber duck method).
